I first sorted the array in ascending order so that the smallest differences would be between consecutive elements. Then I initialized a variable to track the minimum difference. I looped through the array, calculating the difference between each element and its previous element, updating the minimum difference whenever I found a smaller one. Finally, I returned the smallest difference found.
