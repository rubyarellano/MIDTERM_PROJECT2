I first calculated the total sum of all elements in the array. Then, I kept track of the running sum on the left side as I iterated through each element. For every element, I computed the right sum by subtracting the left sum and the current element from the total sum. If the left sum and right sum were ever equal, I returned "YES". If no such point was found after checking the entire array, I returned "NO".
