I first sorted the array of toy weights in ascending order. Then I initialized a counter for containers and a pointer to iterate through the array. For each container, I took the lightest toy as the minimum weight, incremented the container count, and moved the pointer past all toys that fit within 4 units of that minimum. I repeated this process until all toys were placed, and finally returned the total number of containers.
