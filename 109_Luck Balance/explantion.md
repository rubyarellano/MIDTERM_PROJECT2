I first separated the contests into important and unimportant ones. I added all unimportant contest luck values directly to my total luck. For the important contests, I sorted them in descending order so I could lose the **k** most valuable ones to maximize luck. I then added the luck values of the top **k** important contests and subtracted the rest. Finally, I returned the total luck balance.
