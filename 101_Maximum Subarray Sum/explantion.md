I initialized a running prefix sum and a variable to track the maximum sum modulo **m**. As I iterated through the array, I updated the prefix sum modulo **m** and compared it with the current maximum. I kept a sorted list of all prefix sums seen so far. For each new prefix, I used a binary search (**lowerBound**) to find the smallest prefix in the list that is larger than the current prefix, which helps compute a potential larger sum modulo **m**. Finally, I inserted the current prefix into the sorted list and returned the maximum sum found.
