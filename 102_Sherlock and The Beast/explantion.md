I started with all n digits assumed to be fives. Then I reduced the number of fives in multiples of 5 until the remaining count of fives was divisible by 3. If it became negative, I printed -1 because no decent number was possible. Otherwise, I calculated the number of threes as the remaining digits. Finally, I built the number by repeating "5" and "3" the required number of times and printed the result.
