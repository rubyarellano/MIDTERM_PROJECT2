I first created a map to record the positions of each number in the array. Then, I iterated through the array up to k swaps, aiming to place the largest possible number at each position. If the current number wasnâ€™t the largest possible for that position, I swapped it with the number that should be there and updated their positions in the map. I repeated this process until I used all k swaps or reached the end of the array, then returned the resulting array.
